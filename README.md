Abstract

R2M is a new open-source computational toolbox, designed to address the critical challenges of plant health management. R2M provides stakeholders and decision makers with tools to understand, predict and mitigate the risks associated with plant pathogens and pests (garrettlab.com/r2m). R2M includes tools for (a) expert knowledge elicitation (EKE), (b) habitat connectivity analysis, (c) trade network analysis, including GeoPathome, and (d) impact network analysis (INA) for scenario analysis of regional management options. We used the R2M toolbox to evaluate health risks to rice in Nepal. Rice accounts for around 40% of the country's caloric intake. Protecting rice production depends on limiting the spread of crop pathogens and pests. We evaluated rice cropland connectivity risk and rice trade networks, to understand the potential spread of pathogens and pests in Nepal, and to identify priorities regions for surveillance. Rice connectivity is continuous in the lower terai region with neighboring countries.  Informal seed trade within regions of Nepal are highly connected and clustered causing, increased risk of emerging false smut epidemic in Nepal. These analyses can help guide prioritization for rice health management and are a baseline for new collaborations among rice pathologists.
